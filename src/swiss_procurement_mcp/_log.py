"""Structured JSON logging for swiss-procurement-mcp.

OBS-003. The first implementation was stdlib `logging` with a hand-rolled JSON
formatter. It produced structured output, but the re-audit graded it `partial`
on three counts: no structured-logging library in `dependencies`, only two
severity levels ever emitted, and no correlation identifier tying the events of
one tool call together.

`structlog` closes all three, and the third is the reason it is worth a
dependency rather than more hand-rolling: `structlog.contextvars` binds context
to the async task, so every event emitted while a tool runs — including ones
raised deep in the client — carries that call's `correlation_id` without being
threaded through every function signature.

Everything goes to stderr. stdout carries the MCP protocol on a stdio
transport, so a stray line there corrupts the session.
