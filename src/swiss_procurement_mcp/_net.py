"""DNS resolution with an IP blocklist and connection pinning (SEC-004, SEC-005).

The host allow-list in `client.py` answers "is this the name we meant?". It
cannot answer "is this the *machine* we meant?" — a name resolves to an address,
and nothing about an allow-listed hostname prevents that address from being
`169.254.169.254` or `127.0.0.1`. DNS is controlled by whoever runs the zone,
not by us.

Two controls, and they only work together:

**Blocklist.** The resolved address is checked against loopback, private,
link-local, unique-local and unspecified ranges, in both IPv4 and IPv6. The
cloud metadata endpoint `169.254.169.254` falls under link-local, but it is
named explicitly in the tests because it is the address that turns an SSRF into
a credential leak.

**Pinning.** Validating an address and then connecting *by hostname* is a
time-of-check/time-of-use bug: the second lookup can return a different answer
than the first. That is DNS rebinding, and it defeats a blocklist entirely. So
the connection is made to the address that was checked.

The pinning happens in a custom network backend, not by rewriting the request
URL to the literal IP. Both approaches connect to the checked address, but the
rewrite changes what every layer above the socket sees — the response's own
`request.url`, anything that logs it, and route matching in tests. Substituting
only the address the socket is opened to leaves the hostname intact all the way
down, so `Host` and TLS SNI are derived from the name as usual and certificate
validation runs against it. The check catalogue names a "custom resolver" as an
accepted implementation for exactly this reason.

Applied at the connection layer rather than per call, so it also covers
redirects: every hop opens its own connection and passes through here.
