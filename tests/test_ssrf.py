"""SEC-004 / SEC-005: resolved-address blocklist and DNS pinning.

The host allow-list answers "is this the name we meant?". These tests cover the
question it cannot answer — "is this the *machine* we meant?" — because DNS is
controlled by whoever runs the zone.

`test_rebinding_second_lookup_is_never_used` is the one that matters most: it is
the only test here that fails if the address is validated and the connection is
then made by hostname anyway, which is the shape of the bug DNS pinning exists
to prevent.
