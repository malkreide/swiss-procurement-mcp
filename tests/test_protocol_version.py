"""ARCH-012: the MCP protocol version is pinned, and the pin is enforced.

The check asks for an explicit `protocolVersion` — "no latest, no default". The
SDK offers no way to configure it: negotiation happens in the session layer and
neither `FastMCP.__init__` nor `Settings` takes the parameter.

So the pin is a declared constant plus detection. This test is the enforcement
half, and it is deliberately CI-facing rather than runtime-facing: an SDK bump
should break *our* build, not the runtime of someone who upgraded `mcp`
downstream. The server itself only logs a WARNING.
